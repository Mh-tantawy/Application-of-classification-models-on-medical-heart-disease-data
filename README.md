Application of classification models on medical heart disease data
In this project we will built all machine learning models for classification (shown below) using scikit-learn. Our training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.

In this lesson you will learn about...

      Task 1: Import the important library and exploring the dataset
      Task 2: Missing Data
              Identifying Missing Data
              Dealing with Missing Data
      Task 3: Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables
      Task 4: One-Hot Encoding
      Task 5: Logistic regression model
      Task 6: Support vector machine classifier model
      Task 7: K nearest neighbore classifier model
      Task 8: Naieve Bayes model
      Task 9: Decision Tree model
      Task 10: Random Forest model
NOTE:
This tutorial assumes that you are already know the basics of coding in Python and are familiar with the theory behind Logistic Reression, Support Vector Machines,KNN,Naieve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest models. Also you should be aware about The GridSearchCV method, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Regularization, Cross Validation and Confusion Matrices.
