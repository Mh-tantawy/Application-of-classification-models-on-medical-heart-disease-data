# Application of classification models on medical heart disease data
​
In this project we will built all machine learning models for **classification** (shown below) using **scikit-learn**.
Our training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)** to predict whether or not a patient has **[heart disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)**.
​
In this lesson you will learn about...
​
- **Task 1: [Import the important library and exploring the dataset](#download-the-data)**
- **Task 2: [Missing Data](#identify-and-deal-with-missing-data)**
    - Identifying Missing Data
    - Dealing with Missing Data  
- **Task 3: [Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables](#split-the-data)**
- **Task 4: [One-Hot Encoding](#one-hot-enc)**
- **Task 5: [Logistic regression model](#build-log)**
- **Task 6: [Support vector machine classifier model](#build-svm)**
- **Task 7: [K nearest neighbore classifier model](#build-knn)**
- **Task 8: [Naieve Bayes model](#build-nb)**
- **Task 9: [Decision Tree model](#build-dt)**
- **Task 10: [Random Forest model](#build-rf)**

#### NOTE:
This tutorial assumes that you are already know the basics of coding in **Python** and are familiar with the theory behind **Logistic Reression**, **Support Vector Machines**,**KNN**,**Naieve Bayes**, **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models.
Also you should be aware about **The GridSearchCV method**, **Radial Basis Function (RBF)**, **Regularization**, **Cross Validation** and **Confusion Matrices**.
